Your team uses source control and has a continuous integration server,
but are all your builds green?

You can check. I'll wait.

Yeah, we all know the build should be green, but all the email alert
caused the team to create a filter rule.

Over the last five years, we found the best solution for adding a build
light to your continuous integration server. We tried the beacons with
the rotating reflector. We've tried USB connections from the build
server to the light. Then we realized our CI server wasn't located in
each teams area. So we tried the X10 remote outlets and struggled with  and moved to X10 remote outlets, but had the best success
with the reliable LED beacon that doesn't have moving parts and the Web
power strip.

How much is your time worth? We spent countess hours learning the
best solution for a build light.

Included:
* Web power strip 
* Blue (or Red) LED Beacon
* Python Script
* Step by step installation instructions
