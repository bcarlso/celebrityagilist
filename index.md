# It started as a joke...and a t-shirt. 
We aren't famous and don't want to be celebrities. Quite the opposite. We view ego as a hurdle to improvement for
individuals and teams. Calling us "Celebrity Agilists" is a light hearted slam which
we thought was fun.

However we realized there are many members in the agile community
that don't have a platform to share their ideas. What if we took the
ironic label and allowed everyone to be a "Celebrity Agilist"?

## How does it work?

There are four ways you can participate:

1. Read the articles. Point your rss reader to our
[feed](http://celebrityagilist.com/feed.xml "Rss Feed") and read...hey
that rhymes!
2.
[Signup](http://celebrityagilist.us7.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=f98d4ec093c6ac5e665c2347c&id=c262766b55)
to receive the articles via email.
3. Provide articles to share with others in the community.
4. All the above

## How to provide articles?

I'm glad you asked. There are two ways to submit an article:

### 1. E-mail
Send me an [email](mailto:tim@celebrityagilist.com ) with:
* Your article
* A 200x200 pixel image that represents yourself
* Link to your online profile (LinkedIn, Website, Twitter, Facebook).

If you care about formatting you can use
[Dillinger](http://dillinger.io/) to see how it looks.

### 2. Fork the GitHub Repository and Submit a Pull Request
The preferred way for the agile developers.

1. Fork the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/timgifford/celebrityagilist/tree/gh-pages )
2. Checkout the gh-pages branch
3. Write the article in
[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax/ ) and
place it in the \_posts\ folder.
4. Submit a Pull request via GitHub.
